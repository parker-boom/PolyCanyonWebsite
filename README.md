### How Does It Work?

This project was built with longevity in mind—a digital repository designed to outlive me. To achieve this, I chose a robust yet simple approach:

- **Static Data Repository:**  
  All information about Poly Canyon is stored in a centralized JSON file. During the build process, a script generates local JSON files from this master file. This centralized file leverages GitHub Gateway with Netlify to serve as a static database—offering the benefits of dynamic data management without the overhead of a live server.

- **CMS Integration:**  
  When updates are needed, our CMS triggers a Git commit that updates the JSON file. This, in turn, rebuilds and regenerates the website automatically—ensuring that the archive stays fresh and accurate with minimal fuss.

- **Modern, Responsive Design:**  
  Built with React and styled-components, the website features tailored designs for both mobile and desktop viewing, guaranteeing an optimal experience on any device.
