          Every structure in the canyon began as a senior project, but each grew
          far beyond its original scope. Students from architecture,
          engineering, and construction worked together, testing new ideas at
          full scale. What makes these projects remarkable isn&apos;t just their
          experimental natureâ€”it&apos;s how they challenged everyone involved.
          Simple drawings became complex problems. Initial timelines stretched
          as students grappled with real materials, weather, and terrain. Yet
          these challenges created something remarkable: the purest example of
          learning by doing. While each structure explored different techniques
          and scales, they all share this legacy of pushing boundaries through
          collaboration.
