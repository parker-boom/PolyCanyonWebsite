THE PEOPLE
This document outlines the structure and content for the People section of the Poly Canyon Chronicles, focusing on design, narrative, and interactivity to highlight the human side of the canyon’s story.

General Design for People Section
Theme: All-black background with glowing gold accents for text, soft white highlights for visual balance, and a polished, immersive aesthetic.
Header Area: No header; the focus is entirely on the content to maintain immersion.
Main Paragraph: A rounded rectangle in the center with the following narrative:
“Poly Canyon is nothing without its people—it is a living, breathing demonstration of tens of thousands of hours of labor, countless dreams, and the tireless efforts of those who believed in its potential. Aspiring architects dreamt of what could be, student builders turned dreams into projects that defied expectations, and caretakers nurtured the canyon’s spirit across decades with dedication and care. Faculty inspired generations of students, guiding them to push boundaries and reimagine what was possible, while donors and organizations provided the vital support needed to transform bold dreams into tangible creations. To truly appreciate the canyon, you must understand that its identity and value were not discovered—they were forged and fought for by generations of people who, knowing they wouldn’t see the results of their efforts, still worked tirelessly to lay a foundation for others to build upon.”
