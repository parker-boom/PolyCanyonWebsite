THE PROJECTS

PARAGRAPH
These projects were built by Cal Poly students who set out to do what first seemed impossible. Many began untested and uncertain, filled with the fear of failure but driven by purpose. Through an unshakable belief in their work and the process, they embraced what it means to learn by doing. These projects became more than assignments—they were transformations, shaping not only the canyon but the students themselves and inspiring generations to come.
Poly Canyon’s projects redefined what architecture and engineering students could accomplish. Some reimagined sustainability, creating structures that worked in harmony with the environment. Others were feats of technical ingenuity, pushing the limits of design and construction. They range from practical homes to visionary experiments, from bold new builds to careful restorations. Each structure carries the DNA of collaboration, built by interdisciplinary teams who passed the torch from one generation to the next. Some projects were left unfinished, others weathered by time, but all of them remain part of an ever-evolving story. The canyon is not full of relics—it’s full of living chronicles of ambition, innovation, and the relentless pursuit of new ideas.

UI Design
Top Section: Randomized Project Image Carousel
A rotating carousel of high-quality images showcasing various projects in the canyon.
Images transition smoothly every few seconds, creating a dynamic, ever-changing display.
Captions fade in briefly during transitions, providing the project name and year of completion
Main Content: Project Summary Blurb
A rounded rectangle centered below the carousel, containing the project description paragraph above.
Black background with glowing gold text and subtle white accents to match the overall theme.
Interactive Element: "Roll the Dice" Button
Below the blurb, a glowing gold button labeled "Roll the Dice" opens the structure info view for a random structure
