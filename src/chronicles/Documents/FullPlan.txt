Chronicles Context Guide

This document provides the essential context and high-level plan for developing the Chronicles page of the Poly Canyon website. The Chronicles is a web-only, interactive experience designed to engage users through immersive storytelling and deep UI integration. Below is the comprehensive guide to ensure clarity and direction during development.

Purpose

The Chronicles page serves as an interactive, full-screen experience that educates users about the history, environment, and people of Poly Canyon. It uses rich visuals, animations, and seamless transitions to create a dynamic walkthrough, setting it apart from the rest of the website. The goal is to make learning about the canyon engaging and memorable.

Technical Overview

Frameworks: React.js

Styling: Styled Components

Hosting: Static hosting on Netlify

Interactivity: JavaScript for dynamic elements, animations, and transitions

The Chronicles page is independent of the main site’s standard navigation, offering a unique, encapsulated experience. It will feature custom animations, deep integration of interactive elements, and a highly polished design.

Chronicles Home Page

Overview:

The home page serves as the gateway to the Chronicles experience, featuring:

Full-Screen Design: A completely immersive layout distinct from the rest of the site.

Modified Header: A simplified, minimalistic header with an exit button to return to the main site.

Black Background with Floating Circles: Each circle represents one of the four areas (Origins, The Wilds, The People, and The Projects).

Circle Design: Blurred background images with white text overlaid, representing each area.

Hover Effects: Circles subtly enlarge and glow when hovered over.

Interactivity:

Clicking a circle transitions the user to a full-screen experience for the selected area.

Navigation Behavior:

The Chronicles page is isolated; users must "exit" it to return to the main site.

Transitions between areas will be smooth and animated, maintaining a cohesive visual style across all sections.

Four Areas of the Chronicles

Overview of Areas:

Origins: Chronicles the early history of Poly Canyon, focusing on its transformation from untouched land to a hub for experimentation and innovation.

Theme: Historical storytelling with rich visuals and interactive timelines.

The Wilds: Highlights the canyon’s natural environment, including its climate, vegetation, wildlife, and geology.

Theme: Immersive visuals with interactive elements like maps and dynamic overlays.

The People: Focuses on the individuals and groups who shaped the canyon—faculty, students, caretakers, donors, and builders.

Theme: Storylines that humanize the canyon’s history with personal and communal narratives.

The Projects: Celebrates the architectural and experimental projects that define Poly Canyon’s identity.

Theme: Interactive exploration of structures, innovations, and the "learn by doing" ethos.

Flow and Experience:

Each area provides a distinct, yet interconnected, experience:

Origins:

Users uncover content through staged questions that reveal historical narratives when interacted with.

Different eras are shown at each time, with users having to click to move through eras and unveil each era with a question

The Wilds:

A curved slider allows users to navigate categories like climate, vegetation, and hydrology.

Dynamic charts, maps, and animations visually represent environmental data and a main paragraph explains

The People:

Clicking on categories (faculty, caretakers, builders) opens storylines presented as floating captions paired with visuals or graphics.

Personal anecdotes and historical highlights bring depth to the narrative.

The Projects:

A rotating carousel displays project images with captions.

Interactive elements like "Roll the Dice" allow users to explore random projects.

Development Workflow

Chronicles Home Page:

Develop the immersive layout and navigation with floating circles.

Implement transitions and animations for entering and exiting the page.

Individual Areas:

Parker will provide detailed plans for each section (e.g., Origins, The Wilds).

Use the provided content and UI/UX designs to create tailored, interactive experiences.

Iterative Improvement:

Refine each section through continuous feedback, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Design Principles

Visual Cohesion: Black backgrounds, glowing gold text, and organic animations unify the experience.

Interactivity: Engaging users with hover effects, sliders, and dynamic visual elements.

Accessibility: Ensure smooth navigation and clarity, with accessible text and visuals.

Immersion: Prioritize transitions, animations, and storytelling to fully engage the audience.

This guide provides the foundational context for developing the Chronicles page and its four areas. Further details will be attached for each specific section during development to ensure clarity and alignment.
