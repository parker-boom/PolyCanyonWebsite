/*
Components to fix:
1. Move body paragraphs to surround photogrid
2. Reduce padding/margins on geology 
3. Scale up bullets in the mode picker
4. Scale up tips to visit, add live API?

*/

/*
IDEA: Add live weather API or other live information in this section
*/

/**
 * Component: InfoPage
 * Purpose: Provides detailed information about Poly Canyon, including its history, geology, and access to the Poly Canyon app.
 * Key Features: Interactive image carousel, Google Maps route integration, virtual tour/adventure mode switching, and dynamic loading of more information sections.
 * Dependencies: react-icons for icons, GoogleMapsRoute and PhotoGrid components for map and image functionalities, styled-components for layout and design.

          <Text style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>
            Poly Canyon is a 9-acre outdoor laboratory where Cal Poly students
            have been building experimental structures since 1963. Just a mile
            from campus, it&apos;s home to over 30 unique architectural
            projects, ranging from innovative housing models to experimental
            bridges. The canyon sits within one of California&apos;s most
            complex geological regions, where volcanic basalt meets serpentine
            rock, creating a challenging and dynamic building environment.
            <br />
            <br />
            These aren&apos;t just display pieces. Each structure was designed
            and built by students testing new ideas in real-world conditions.
            The projects showcase everything from sustainable design principles
            to experimental construction techniques, with some using innovative
            materials like post-tensioned steel and sprayed concrete. Some
            projects succeeded brilliantly, while others showed why certain
            ideas stayed theoretical ‚Äì both outcomes equally valuable for
            learning.

            Your personal guide to exploring these architectural wonders. Find
            your way around with interactive maps, uncover the stories behind
            each structure, and track your progress as you discover the area.
            The app transforms a simple walk through the canyon into an
            educational experience, combining historical photos, architectural
            insights, and location-aware features to bring each structure&apos;s
            story to life.

            Access the area by walking along Poly Canyon Road on campus. The
            interactive map below shows the route, or use AllTrails and Google
            Maps for detailed directions.

            Choose your path - hike, bike, or run. The trail is well-marked and
            takes about 20 minutes to walk from campus. The wide, gently sloping
            road makes it perfect for mountain biking, while runners enjoy the
            moderate incline for training. During the day, you&apos;ll be
            treated to sweeping views of rolling hills and coastal mountains,
            while clear nights offer excellent stargazing opportunities away
            from city lights. It&apos;s equally rewarding as a quick
            architectural tour or a longer nature expedition.
