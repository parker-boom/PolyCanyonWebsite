            Design Village is an annual competition hosted by Cal Poly's College of Architecture and Environmental Design that brings together students from various institutions to design, build, and inhabit temporary structures in Poly Canyon. Participants create inhabitable shelters based on a specific theme each year, transporting materials by hand up a mile-long uphill path to assemble their structures without power tools. The event emphasizes collaboration, creativity, and real-world application of architectural skills, culminating in a vibrant community experience with social activities such as a Night Market and concerts.

          Poly Canyon is a living testament to the power of hands-on learning and architectural innovation. Nestled in the hills just a mile from Cal Poly's main campus, this 9-acre outdoor classroom has been inspiring students since 1963. Here, amidst the natural beauty of the landscape, aspiring architects and designers transform their boldest ideas into reality, creating structures that challenge conventions and push the boundaries of design. The canyon is dotted with over 30 permanent projects, each telling a unique story of student creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving. In this extraordinary space, the theoretical becomes tangible, and students don't just learn about architecture ‚Äì they live it, breathe it, and build it with their own hands.
