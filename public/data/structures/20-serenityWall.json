  "description": "The student who built the Serenity Wall also constructed two other unlisted structures: the Meditation Bench and Cardinal Direction. Designed to blend seamlessly with its surroundings, this structure embodies the principle of 'out of sight, out of mind.'",
  "extended_description": "Constructed with weather-resistant redwood planks, it requires minimal maintenance while complementing the natural environment. The wall serves as a subtle gateway to other canyon features, demonstrating how architecture can enhance rather than dominate a landscape. It reflects a thoughtful approach to design that prioritizes harmony with nature.",
