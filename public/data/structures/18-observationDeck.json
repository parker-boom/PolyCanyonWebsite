  "description": "The Observation Deck was completed just one day before the team's graduation, making it their final achievement as Cal Poly students. This redwood structure offers panoramic views of the surrounding hills.",
  "extended_description": "Serving as both a rest stop for hikers and a symbol of Poly Canyon's rejuvenation, its construction represents a renewed push for student-led projects in the area. The deck's design balances functionality with aesthetic appeal, providing a peaceful vantage point that encourages appreciation of the canyon's natural beauty and architectural diversity. It stands as a lasting legacy of the students' dedication and hard work.",
