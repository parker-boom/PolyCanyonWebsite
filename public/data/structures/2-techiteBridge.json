  "description": "The Techite Bridge is the only Poly Canyon structure built entirely by Construction Engineering students, highlighting their hands-on expertise. Constructed from fiber-reinforced plastic mortar, it showcases innovative use of lightweight yet high-strength materials. The bridge exemplifies how students can bridge gaps in more ways than one.",
  "extended_description": "As a testament to interdisciplinary collaboration, the Techite Bridge stands out for its creative application of construction techniques. The use of fiber-reinforced plastic mortar not only demonstrates technical skill but also innovation in material science. This lightweight yet durable bridge reflects the students' ability to think outside the box. It remains a symbol of student-driven experimentation in construction. The structure continues to inspire future generations of engineers and architects at Cal Poly.",
