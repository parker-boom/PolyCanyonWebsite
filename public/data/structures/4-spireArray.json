  "description": "Wild horses are often spotted near the Spire Arrayâ€”did you see any today? This striking wooden structure explores minimalist construction methods using simple materials, resembling teepee-like forms.",
  "extended_description": "Created to investigate efficient building techniques, the geometric design allows natural light to filter through, offering a dynamic play of shadow and space. The project exemplifies how basic materials can be transformed into complex, visually intriguing structures through innovative design. It serves as a testament to the creativity and resourcefulness of students. The Spire Array adds a unique aesthetic to the Poly Canyon landscape. It encourages visitors to reflect on the possibilities of minimalist architecture.",
