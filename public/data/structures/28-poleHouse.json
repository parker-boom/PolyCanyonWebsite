  "description": "Built on a steep slope, the Pole House stands tall thanks to deep caissons that anchor directly into bedrock! Addressing the challenges of a sloping site, this structure is elevated on caissons that transfer the load directly to the bedrock below.",
  "extended_description": "This innovative foundation technique makes it a structurally sound solution for difficult terrains. Often used as a staging ground for other projects, the Pole House highlights the adaptability of architectural design to the natural landscape, embodying practical ingenuity. It demonstrates how thoughtful engineering can overcome environmental obstacles. The structure serves as an educational model for foundation design.",
