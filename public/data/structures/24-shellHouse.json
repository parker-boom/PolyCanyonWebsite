  "description": "During construction of the Shell House, students got unexpected shocksâ€”they learned the hard way about grounding when working with wire mesh and shotcrete! An early pioneer in using shotcrete at Poly Canyon, the Shell House features a unique roof formed by cables, wire mesh, and sprayed concrete.",
  "extended_description": "The students faced unexpected electrical shocks due to improper grounding, adding a memorable lesson to the building process. Supported at just three ground points, this structure exemplifies innovation and the hands-on challenges that come with experimental architecture. The Shell House stands as a testament to the learning experiences that shape architectural education. It continues to be a symbol of ingenuity and practical problem-solving.",
