  "description": "This bridge stands as a tribute to Keigen Langholff, a passionate student whose contributions to Poly Canyon were cut tragically short. It showcases the strength and versatility of timber in bridge construction.",
  "extended_description": "Recently retrofitted, the structure continues to serve as a hands-on learning tool for students, allowing them to study and experience firsthand the principles of structural engineering in a real-world application. The bridge's design incorporates complex truss systems, emphasizing the importance of structural integrity and design. It stands as both a memorial and an educational resource. The Timber Truss bridge inspires future architects and engineers through its enduring presence.",
