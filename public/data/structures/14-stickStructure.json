  "description": "Intended to change shapes regularly, the Stick Structure stood unchanged for decades before students gave it a fresh makeover. Originally built as a life-sized structural stability model, it allows students to explore load flow and stiffness in various configurations.",
  "extended_description": "Although it was meant for regular reconfiguration, it remained the same for years until a renovation in 2009 revived its purpose. This hands-on educational tool demonstrates the principles of structural design in a tangible, full-scale format, emphasizing the longevity of student innovation. The Stick Structure serves as a testament to the enduring value of experimental architecture and the importance of continual learning and adaptation in design.",
