  "description": "The Cantilever Deck appears to float in mid-air, thanks to two students who defied gravity with cables and creativity. Constructed by ambitious architecture students, it exemplifies the principles of cantilever construction.",
  "extended_description": "Suspended entirely by cables with no direct ground support, it showcases the perfect balance of tension and compression forces. This minimalist design is a real-world application of structural precision, highlighting how innovative engineering can create the illusion of a floating platform amid the natural landscape. The deck provides a unique space for contemplation and observation. It challenges conventional architectural norms. The Cantilever Deck continues to inspire awe and curiosity among visitors.",
