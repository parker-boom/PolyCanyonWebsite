  "description": "One student loved the Tensile structure so much, they got married under itâ€”a testament to its beauty and community spirit. Showcasing structural elegance, it is held up by twelve footings interconnected underground.",
  "extended_description": "Utilizing tension cables and fabric, the structure provides much-needed shade during events like Design Village. The fact that a student chose this spot for their wedding adds a personal dimension, highlighting how architecture can foster community and create meaningful spaces beyond their functional purpose. The Tensile structure exemplifies the harmonious blend of form and function. It continues to be a focal point for gatherings and events. The design inspires visitors to appreciate the possibilities of tensile architecture.",
