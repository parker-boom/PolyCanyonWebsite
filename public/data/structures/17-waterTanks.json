  "description": "These tanks tap into a spring that feeds Brizzolara Creek, connecting modern engineering with the area's natural water sources! Situated near a hillside spring, the Water Tanks play a crucial role in Poly Canyon's infrastructure.",
  "extended_description": "The original tank faced issues holding water above a certain level, which was ingeniously solved with the addition of polyvinyl storage tanks. This project highlights sustainable resource management and how engineering solutions can evolve over time to meet functional challenges while respecting natural resources. The Water Tanks exemplify the integration of technology with environmental stewardship.",
