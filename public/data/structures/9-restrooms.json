  "description": "These restrooms were shaped by dirt! Students used earth mounds as molds, then dug them out to reveal the curvy concrete roof. Ingeniously using earth mounds as natural formwork, they seamlessly blend with the landscape.",
  "extended_description": "After the concrete cured, the soil was excavated to reveal a structure that embodies efficient use of materials and environmental integration. Serving as essential infrastructure before other facilities were available, this project highlights the innovative spirit of students merging architecture with nature. The Earth-Formed Restrooms demonstrate sustainable building practices. They serve as an educational example of alternative construction methods. The design continues to intrigue and educate visitors about eco-friendly architecture.",
