  "description": "The Gunite Bridge was sprayed into existence! Students used a gunite machine to apply concrete over a steel skeleton. Demonstrating technical ingenuity, it was constructed using pretension and post-compression techniques.",
  "extended_description": "Students built a reinforced steel skeleton with metal lath and then sprayed it with guniteâ€”a type of concrete applied through a high-pressure hose. Once cured, tension cables were cut to place the structure in compression. This innovative process pushed the limits of concrete application, highlighting student experimentation with advanced construction methods. The bridge serves as a historical example of material and structural innovation. It continues to be studied for its unique construction technique. The Gunite Bridge remains a landmark of student creativity and engineering prowess.",
