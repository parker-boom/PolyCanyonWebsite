  "description": "Each beam of the Moment Monument is connected differently, making it a unique educational tool for students studying earthquake-resistant design. As the newest addition to Poly Canyon, this structure serves as an educational tool for earthquake-resistant design.",
  "extended_description": "Each beam is connected differently, allowing students to study various pre-qualified moment connections in steel frames. The monument exemplifies how full-scale models can enhance understanding of complex engineering principles, bridging the gap between theory and practice. It stands as a hands-on resource for learning about seismic resilience. The Moment Monument represents the forefront of educational architecture.",
